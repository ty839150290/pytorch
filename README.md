The file is divided into 6 parts.I'll interpret every part as follows:
The task of the first part is to get the database,which is ready to the training.
The task of the second part is to show the picture and the label.
The task of the third part is to build the frame of the net,and set some parameters.
The task of the forth part is to train the model.
The task of the fifth part is to test the result of training.
The task of the sixth part is to culculate the accuracy rate of the net.
